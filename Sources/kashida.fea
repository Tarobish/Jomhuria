// Kashida justification as implemented in most, if not all, applications is
// broken by design; it inserts kashidas *after* doing OT layout which makes it
// impossible for OT code to interact with those kashidas breaking all sorts of
// things.
// To trick LibreOffice/MS Office to not do kashida justification we set the
// default kashida to a zero width, blank glyph which makes them to think there
// is no suitable kashida glyph, resorting back to regular justification
// To get manually inserted kashida working we use an rlig feature to map to the
// actual kashida glyph(s).
