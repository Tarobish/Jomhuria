The first release of Jomhuria.

We removed thousands of glyphs from the Arabic part of the font: from 6068 glyphs in Amiri to 1439 glyphs in Jomhuria. Jomhuria is a much less complex script than Amiri and we had legacy Unicode ranges covered that are uneeded for Jomhuria.
Alongside with that many of the opentype features became superflous. But we also developed some new features.

Prepare a skeleton project to be filled with glyphs from Amiri. The Glyph drawings of Amiri are in the background layer and as outline-drawings in the foreground layer, so that the right glyphs can be found easiliy in the program overview.

This was on the base of Amiri commit 3b96b99f1546157d594bc7a562e1e47629e07dc7 https://github.com/khaledhosny/amiri-font
